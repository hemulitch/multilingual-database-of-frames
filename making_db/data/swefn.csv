Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords .  NB: For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication. This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware. In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in It was stupid of me to do that. Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:   She is astute at math. While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  ",,"förståelse.n, tveksam.a, klok.a, noggrann.a, snarfyndig.a, klipsk.a, omdöme.n, paranoid.a, löjlig.a, glömsk.a, smart.a, försiktig.adv, dum.a, nyfiken.a, galen.a, vettig.a, oberäknelig.a, flitig.adv, fånig.a, idiotisk.a, nyfiken.adv, försiktig.a, vetgirig.a, likgiltig.adv, karaktär.n, vansinnig.a, misstänksam.a, omsorgsfull.adv, förnuft.n"

A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme. In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  The plane flew over the city.

With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference). The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated. Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).   The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.  The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.    The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  (1)Accidents increased 20% to 345. (1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345. (2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.  In cases like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item. Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  (3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  (4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s. (4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  (5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased from 2000 to 2001  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP ""turbot catches"" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  *Turbot increased in catches.  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  (6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to ""the people"", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1), (2), and (3). The Attribute could be overtly specified:  (6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP ""the population of Smallville"" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer ""of Smallville"" is tagged as Item.   (6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807. (6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807. Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  (6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  (7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001. (7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.  There is no Attribute ""1999 price"" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as ""price"" on the 2nd layer. ",,växla.v

766,956,Hedging,Hedged_content,"When words of this frame are used as hedge markers, they signal that the speaker of the sentence wishes to be careful about asserting some Hedged_content. Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they're expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context. The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy . I 'm sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand . I thought, like, maybe you would know . My father was something of a dilettante . He rather doubts you'll be able to convince your mom. Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express: Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side . There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following: When a standard vaccuum can't even pick up the clods, you know you've kinda got a problem. Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., ""a tad"", ""a little"", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame. However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication. Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number (""a little whiskey"", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average (""a mite stupid"", ""somewhat confused"" see Degree). Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed. Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category (""something of a klutz""), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition (""I, like, waved it around""). In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.",,

When one of the Protagonists serves to define the other (more or less as a Ground), it is called Protagonist_2, and the other is called Protagonist_1 (i.e. the Figure).  This frame exists as a background for a number of lexical frames, including Chatting, Similarity, Exchange, and Being_attached. The most basic frames inheriting from this one are symmetrical states. (For example, Being_attached is symmetrical, since if A is attached to B, B is attached to A.)   Other frames exhibiting reciprocality either have a causative/inchoative relation to such a stative frame (e.g. ), or are stative-like summarizations of multiple events of the same kind. This second type, in which events are performed reciprocally, with two equal participants acting on each other, can be exemplified by the Chatting frame in which two people are effectively both speakers and addressees in a joint act of communication.   The basic characteristic of this frame, inherited in the daughters, is the equivalence of Protagonist_1 + Protagonist_2 to Protagonists, and the further equivalence (modulo figure/ground profiling) of the following:  Protagonist_1 Relation with Protagonist_2.

The relevant Means action is often evoked only by reference to an Intermediary who performs it. Also, if the Protagonist performs the Means action themselves, the Instrument that they use may be referred to in place of the Means Note that when one of the three interrelated FEs Means, Instrument and Intermediary is realized overtly, the other two are blocked from overt realization as clause-level arguments of the target.  When the Protagonist is a sentient being, it is implied that they put their trust in the Intermediary to help in the achievement of the Benefit.   The extent to which the Protagonist is dependent on an Intermediary or Instrument can be indicated in a Degree phrase.  A set of Circumstances in which the Protagonist's need for the Benefit arises, may also be specified.    The difference between the Benefit that the Means action provides and the Purpose that the Protagonist has is very subtle. For our purposes we will assume that one can form a predication from Benefit and Means on the one hand, and Protagonist and Purpose on the other, but that they cannot be intermingled (cf. examples (7) and (8) below).

1 269,1126,Remembering_experience,Cognizer Experience Impression Salient_entity State Context Duration Manner Time Vividness,"A Cognizer calls up an episodic memory of past Experience or an Impression of a Salient_entity formed on the basis of past experience. The Cognizer may also remember the Salient_entity in a particular State, which serves as a frame of reference in the Cognizer's mind. When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.   Episodic memory is the explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.   Kozmo could remember when his modem was the fastest he could buy.  That's probably before my time, which was long time ago, Fish may remember that time.

It can be used to talk about detailed reports of past experience.  I don't know if I lost consciousness for a while. But I remember that I was lying in the middle of the road with people trying to assist me.    Notice that Mental_content reported within this frame is presented as factive, i.e. as reliable and accurate. Consider the following contrasts:  1a. I remember her as selfish--but I might be wrong. 1b. ??I remember that she was selfish--but I might be wrong.  2a. Bill remembers her as smarter than she is. 2b.*Bill remembers that she is smarter than she is.  The (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest that the Cognizer takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate.  The concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.  3a. I remember her fondly 3b. Please take a moment to remember Caesar and his Family. 3c. Do you remember Alexander the Great? He was one of history's most prolific conquerors, and he did it all in his twenties.   This frame differs from Remembering_to_do in that this frame is strictly talking about a fact, whereas the Remembering_to_do frame is strictly about tasks which the Cognizer would be expected to do.
