There are a number of less productive metaphors that are also intended to be included in this frame, e.g. """"behavior bordering on lunacy"""", """"cleanliness is next to godliness"""", despite the fact that conventionally we do not find """"adjacent to lunacy"""", etc. Though these expressions sound creative, they are immediately understandable and contextually unobjectionable.",Adjacency,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/1192,ExactMatch,

While all the members of this frame denote possible situations, in principle, this frame could be split into a number of subtypes on the following basis:
1. Future.n, and most uses of alternative.n and possibility.n all evoke nothing more than a simple possible situation (not necessarily an Situation) with no Agent; the remaining frames would inherit from this.
2. Use.n evokes different possible things that can be done with a Salient_entity (i.e., Purposes) and thus uses the Using frame; in this frame, the target denotes the Purpose that can be achieved.
3. way.n evokes different events that can lead to an Outcome (not necessarily a Purpose); this frame should use the Means frame. In this frame, the target denotes the possible Means actions.
4. option.n, choice.n, and many instances of alternative.n and possibility.n, evoke possible Situations that an implicit or explicit Agent can bring about at will. A Purpose that would be served by bringing these Situations about may be mentioned.

Value","The absolute Value of a quantifiable Attribute of an item is determined by adding up the values for the Attribute of the individuals or parts that make up the item. The item is not expressed as a separate constituent but it is presupposed by the concept of Attribute. Alternatively, the Numbers form an implicit set whose sum is the Value associated with the set. In some cases what is reported is just the cardinality of the individuals that make up the item so that in effect the Value is a count. In other cases the identity of the Attribute can only be inferred from the Value.

There is no cognizer on the scene in this frame. Instead, the frame focuses on the relationship between the Attribute or Numbers and the Value, which is stable and unchanging regardless of who performs the calculation.

something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be
connected to each other. In the first, the frame includes an
Agent who attaches an Item to a Goal by
manipulating a Connector, creating an asymmetric relationship
between the Item and the Goal. In the second, the
Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each
serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric
relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the
Connector remains to bind the two entities (either
Item and Goal, or two Items), without
creating a new entity.

Very frequently, an entity involved in a Means action stands in for the Means, and similarly a Goal may be metonymically expressed with an entity related to a Goal situation:

John tried a crowbar on the door.
They tried the window in order to rob the store.

Unlike the Attempt frame, the Means is focused upon, and the Goal is often implicit. This frame answers the question of how something is to be attempted, rather than what is being attempted.

Topic","A Cognizer has a piece of Content in their model of the world. The Content is not necessarily present due to immediate perception, but usually, rather, due to deduction from perceivables. In some cases, the deduction of the Content is implicitly based on confidence in sources of information (believe), in some cases based on logic (think), and in other cases the source of the deduction is deprofiled (know).

Your boss is aware of your commitment.

Note that this frame is undergoing some degree of reconsideration. Many of the targets will be moved to the Opinion frame. That frame indicates that the Cognizer considers something as true, but the Opinion (compare to Content) is not presupposed to be true; rather it is something that is considered a potential point of difference, as in the following:

I think that you are awesome.

In the uses that will remain in the Awareness frame, however, the Content is presupposed.


This frame is also distinct from the Certainty frame, in that it does not profile the relationship of the Cognizer to the Content, but rather presupposes it. In Certainty, the Degree of confidence or certainty is expressible as a separate frame element, as in the following:

Topic","Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer adding some Phenomenon to their model of the world. They are similar to Coming-to-believe words, except the latter generally involve reasoning from Evidence.

The words in this frame take direct objects that denote entities in the world, and indicate awareness of those entities, without necessarily giving any information about the content of the Cognizer's belief or knowledge. These words also resemble perception words, since creatures often become aware of things by perceiving them.

Theme","The Borrower takes possession of a Theme with the knowledge that the Borrower will have to give the Theme back to the Lender after a Duration of time. This frame differs from the Lending frame in that this frame profiles the Borrower in active sentences, whereas the Lending frame profiles the Lender.

For the time being, this frame includes both the transfer event itself and the end state of the event, as shown in the first two examples following:

I am borrowing the book about modal particles from the professor.

I borrowed the book from him and returned it a long time ago.

Not only did I|Borr have to borrow a gown, but I was also lent a jacket!

The girl|Borr borrowed the car from her sister for a couple days.

Along with other ways of temporarily taking possession (e.g. """"putting something in your pocket for a while""""), this frame is used non-literally to refer to Stealing. In this use, the Borrower is a thief, the Lender is a Victim, and the Theme is the Goods:

Unit
Whole","Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).
Jo's mother will visit on this coming [Tuesday|Unit].

Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context. So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context. In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.

On [April|Target] 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI.
I 'll come back in [April|Unit] .DNI

Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).
On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .
In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI.
On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI

Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred. To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following:
Last [Tuesday|Target] she said I 'd have to come back .
Last [Tuesday|Landmark_period] she said I 'd have to come back .
We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.). Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate:
The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .
December 11 was when Alix finally left .
The 23rd will be snowy . DNI
Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI
As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction:
No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !
No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !


Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but in the morning) and ones in which calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as N-after-N (e.g. day after day), N-by-N (e.g. week by week), N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002). Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).",Calendric_unit,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/206,ExactMatch,

Number
Unit","This frame presents a situation where there is a certain Number of instances of an Entity or a certain Number that quantifies a Unit. Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as. Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit. Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num).

There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called """"round"""" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like """"about"""", etc.

Dr. Malik has confined almost a [score|Num] of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.

There were [thirty|Num|Target] of the little blue creatures staring up at him.
She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had [ten|Number]! DNI
The ship was [three|Number] degrees off course .


This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions. Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. """"three hundred"""". Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without """"and"""", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.

Stephen has more than five|mul [hundred|Target] in his closet! DNI


As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:

There are just over [six|Number] billion people in the world today.
There are just over|deg six [billion|Num|Target] people in the world today.

The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one. In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent. Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English. Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary. As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., """"3"""" is a wordform of three.num).

Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation. These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (""""A whopping three singers showed up"""")



Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between """"six apples"""" and """"six of the apples"""". It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have. In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set. There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that """"six of the apples"""" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples. Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity. However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like """"six of the apples"""".",Cardinal_numbers,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/196,ExactMatch,

Goods","A Distributor sells, lends, or otherwise distributes a class of Goods. In the prototypical case, the Distributor is a retailer who generally keeps some type of Goods on site for the purpose of selling it to a buyer. Extensions include lending Goods (e.g., libraries, movie rental outlets), organization-internal distribution (as in a hospital), or other non-commercial distribution centers. The Goods are constrained to be a type of item (e.g., canned goods, antique dressers) rather than a particular or unique item (e.g., Smith's last self-portrait, that guitar I saw here last week). Note that a Distributor may carry some particular goods, but may not have it on hand at that exact moment.

Affected","A Cause causes an Effect. Alternatively, an Actor, a participant of a (implicit) Cause, may stand in for the Cause. The entity Affected by the Causation may stand in for the overall Effect situation or event.

Those frames that inherit the Causation frame have as their background the idea that some event is responsible for the occurrence of another event (or state). In the inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in. Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target. So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).

Effect","A Cause brings about an Effect that would not have occurred otherwise, simultaneously preventing an Averted_situation, which is what would have occurred without the Cause. The Effect and the Averted_situation are thus mutually exclusive alternatives prior to the Cause event. In most cases, either the Effect or the Averted_situation is clearly most prominent; this is especially true in the case where the Cause is the action of an Agent, who normally conceives of their action as either bringing about a desirable Effect or avoiding an undesirable Averted_situation.

In frames that inherit from this one, the Cause is either an event, or an entity that plans or directly causes the Effect may metonymically stand in for the Cause event.",Causation_scenario,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/195,ExactMatch,

Source
Theme","An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal. Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.

This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion. Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/#Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v). For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion. For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.

She threw her shoes into the dryer .
The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .
We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .



This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here. The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal):
Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI
She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .
Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI
Croquet was pushed out by tennis .


A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location:
Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .
He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .


Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal):
Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .


Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final:
Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years
One can not press this argument too far .
She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .
She flung him a savage little smile .
All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked """"Metaphor"""", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic.



This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal):


In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal). The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there.
Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.


In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal).
John filled the box with old toys.


In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source).
Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.


In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it.
Jason emptied the box of the old toys .


Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general: either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.",Cause_motion,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/49,ExactMatch,

Selector","This frame concerns the appointment of a New_leader or removal from office of an Old_leader. The Selector brings about the change in leadership, for example, by electing or overthrowing a leader. There are two particular situations described by words in this frame: 1. making a New_leader fill a Role whether or not there was someone in the role previously (e.g., crown.v), and 2. successfully removing an Old_leader from office (e.g. depose.v, oust.v).

On March 17 , Mamedov appointed Rakhim Gasiyev as Defence Minister .

This frame should be compared to the Reject_leadership frame, in which there is only an attempt to change the power structure. Compare also to the Appointing frame, which is used for words that refer to officially empowered agents designating entities to fill a particular function. In the Appointing frame, the function may or may not be a leadership role, unlike targets in the Change_of_leadership frame.",Change_of_leadership,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/66,ExactMatch,

Item
Value_range","This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference). The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated. Another scale (Correlated_variable), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).


The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the
Attribute in an in-PP.

Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.

The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.

Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.



The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.

(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345|val2.
(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.
(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months
DNI.

In cases like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes
it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has
to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the
Item. Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.

(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990|val2 DNI.

A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.

(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s|val1 to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s|val2.
(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s|att to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s|att.

(Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.

(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased from 2000 to 2001

As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP """"turbot catches"""" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:

*Turbot increased in catches.

Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.

(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.


Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to """"the people"""", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1), (2), and (3). The Attribute could be overtly specified:

(6a) The population of Smallville|ite increased fourfold|Diff in size|att to 807|val2.

Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP """"the population of Smallville"""" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer """"of Smallville"""" is tagged as Item.

(6b) The population of Smallville|att increased fourfold|Diff to 807|val2.
(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville|ite increased fourfold to 807.
Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).

(6c) Smallville|ite increased fourfold|Diff in population|att to 807|val2.


The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.

(7) The 1999 price|val1 had increased to $3400|val2 by 2001.
(7--second layer) The 1999 price|att had increased to $3400 by 2001.

There is no Attribute """"1999 price"""" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as """"price"""" on the 2nd layer.",Change_position_on_a_scale,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/84,ExactMatch,

Three related frames are Notification_of_charges, Entering_of_plea, and Fining.
This frame is distinguished from Notification_of_charges in that it typically deals with less serious Charges and/or offenses. It also involves more than just notifying the Defendant (Accused in the Notification_of_charges frame) of the Charges being brought against them; LUs in the Citing frame also require that the Defendant take some form of action (go to Court or pay a Fine). Similarly, Citing differs from Entering_of_plea because its scenario encompasses more than the latter; Citing involves steps both before and after the Defendant enters a Plea in answer to Charges. Finally, this frame differs from Fining since the Defendant (Payer in the Fining frame) does not necessarily end up paying a Fine.

The Seller indicates their willingness to give the Goods in their possession to a Buyer who would give them some amount of Money. The Seller may have already decided on the amount of money that they would require, in which case it is called the Asking price.

The Buyer also indicates their willingness to give an amount of money called an Offer to a Seller who would give them the Goods.

Normally the process is begun by the Seller. The means by which the Seller indicates their wish to engage in an exchange are various, ranging from putting a price tag on an item on a store shelf, to advertizing, to communicating directly and specifically with a possible Buyer. In some cases, however, the process may be initiated by the Buyer indicating to a possible Seller that they would like to make an exchange.

NB: For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication. This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware. In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always. Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.

Consequence
Profiled_possibility","In this scene, two mutually exclusive possibilities are presented, the Profiled_possibility and the Opposite_possibility, each of which has a consequence associated with it, the Consequence (associated with the Profiled_possibility) and the Anti_consequence (associated with the Opposite_possibility). Usually, the Consequence and Anti_consequence are also mutually exclusive, but in some cases (especially with """"even if"""") the same Consequence results regardless of whether one considers the Profiled_possibility or the Opposite_possibility. Neither of the possibilities is asserted and neither can simply be merged with a factual understanding of the world. Both possibilities are presented as uncertain, and the Profiled_possibility may be further characterized with a neutral stance towards it, or with a doubtful, negative stance, depending on the specific lexical unit introducing the conditional and what verb forms are used in the Profiled_possibility.


If you read caerfully, you 'll see the letters are swapped.
Unless you read carefully , you wo n't understand what I said .

The most common use of lexical units connected to the Conditional_scenario is for prediction; in this case the conditionals pair up possibilities with predicted consequences. Subtypes of this use include, but are not limited to:

(1) contingencies:
If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.

(2) conditional promises (usually when making a deal):
If you will wait with reasonable patience , I will explain

(3) threats (which are inherently conditional):
If any boy says anything to Weeks about it, I will cane him.

(4) hypotheticals, especially when a different choice was made in the past and one imagines it would lead to a different outcome:
If I had elected to stay there, I probably would not have become homeless five years later.

(5) descriptions of general rules of the world:
You only get shingles if you have had chickenpox.

(6) descriptions of the characteristics of individual entities or persons that have an effect under certain circumstances:
If Joey says you're in, you're in.


Speech act conditionals:

Lexical units of these frames can also be used in a pattern called a """"Speech Act conditional"""". In this case, the conditional presents a statement that is relevant to the conversation if the Profiled_possibility holds.

Just ask for Bob if you need anything.

The relevance of the statement is a Consequence of the Profiled_possibility, but there is no distinct alternative intended, so this usage does not normally allow distancing verb forms (see Dancygier and Sweetser 2005: 114-115). As shown in the above example, we annotate the potentially relevant statement as Consequence. This is based on an analysis of the filler of the Consequence as metonymically expressing a message similar to """"it is relevant to say the following: ..."""". Such cases should be tagged with the clause-level tag """"Speech act"""". Thus in the following example, it is relevant for the speaker to explain the situation by saying """"no, she's not my wife"""" if the other person is wondering about that possibility:

In case you're wondering, no she's not my wife.

Metalinguistic conditionals:

In addition, conditionals can be used to talk about the actual encoding of a message and usually encode a strong opinion about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a description, often in contrast to someone else's contrary opinion. Such sentences should be tagged """"Metalinguistic"""", as in the following:

If that's not success, I don't know what is.

Epistemic conditionals:

Finally, conditionals can be used to profile a reasoning process. While all conditionals mark the connection from a hypothetical situation to an associated conclusion, many conditionals specifically highlight this process of thinking about the connection, especially when the reasoning is cooccurring with speaking, and most obviously when reasoning from effects to causes. In such cases as the following, we mark the clause as """"Epistemic"""":

If the lights are on, then somebody is home.

Many sentences are vague about exactly to what degree they profile the reasoning process, so sentences like the following can be legitimately labeled """"Epistemic"""" or not:

If you believe that what you are doing is right then you can't compromise.


Special constructions:

Conditionals interact significantly with ellipsis constructions, particularly because they often occur in parallel structures in which different possibilities are being contrasted, or cases in which there is a contrast between what is always true and what is only conditionally true. In these cases, the Profiled_possibility and the Consequence or Anti_consequence may be abbreviated under the same conditions that apply to ellipsis in the rest of the language. See the following examples:

She would visit for at least a week and, if necessary, an additional day or two.

In these examples, """"an additional day or two"""" is understood as """"she would stay an additional day or two"""", based on the immediately preceding sentence. This is a general construction that allows a finite sentence that is parallel to an immediately adjacent clause to be abbreviated just to the content in addition to or contrasting with the adjacent clause. Since it must be interpreted as a full clause and occurs in exactly the places a clause is expected, we actually annotate the PT of the Consequence as """"Sfin"""" in these cases. The adjective """"necessary"""" in the Profiled_possibility, however, is not licensed by a general construction that allows an adjective like necessary to be used arbitrarily in the kinds of places a clause would be found. Therefore, in this case, we consider the adjective to represent a separate valence with PT """"AP"""".",Conditional_scenario,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/1194,ExactMatch,

Patient","An Agent affects a Patient in such a way that the Patient (or some Subregion of the Patient) ends up in a non-canonical state. Often this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected. Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v). For another set of lexical units, the action and its result are much less specified (e.g., damage.v).

Path","This frame covers the basic uses of direction words like the adverbs east, up, and forward. These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north). Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that """"forward"""" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined). Nevertheless, some words like way.n and direction.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available, and obligatorily occur with some other means of specifying the direction (""""that way"""", """"the same way"""", """"the direction she went"""").
This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:
We went [north|Target] . DNI
In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:
After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI
It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:
Look [left|Target] and you 'll see it . DNI
Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:
The book was unreachable, 10 feet [up|Target] on the shelf. DNI
[East|Path] of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.
In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.
Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:
??? The book faced above the door .
vs.
The book faced upward .
A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by """"of"""", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:
??? I faced east of the mountains .
Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word """"to"""". Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame. This applies to expressions like """"to the east"""", as well as """"to both sides"""" and """"to the rear"""". In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.
In the following case, the Domain is """"potency"""" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.
They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .
In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains). The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.",Direction ,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/193,ExactMatch,

Theme","This frame involves a static (primarily spatial) relationship between a Location and a Theme, in which the Theme is located in many or all subregions of the Location, and is thus construable as covering it. The Time when the covering configuration holds, and the Subregion of the Location that is involved may, optionally, be indicated.
By Summer, weeds dotted the field .
The papers around my office were too messy .
Prepositional and verb targets of this frame differ in the ways they can participate in forming sentences; one of the most important differences is that prepositions may modify the entire sentence to describe the event (the Theme) as distributed over the Location.
Puddles were rippling all over the roof .
Some members of this frame specifically indicate that the configuration is attractive or unattractive; this is indicated by the semantic types Positive_judgement and Negative_judgement respectively. Some of the non-verb LUs of the frame (esp. around.prep) refer to multiple possible positions that might be occupied by a single Theme, often accompanied by """"somewhere"""":
I hope my wallet is around here (somewhere) .
These same LUs may refer a vague sequence of locations occupied by a single Theme:
I kept walking around my apartment .
All or virtually all of the verbs used statically in this frame can also occur in the frame Filling, producing pairs such as the following:
Filling: Pat covered the table with flowers.
Distributed_position: Flowers covered the table.
Please note: adorned, covered, etc are in the Abounding_with frame because of the point of view shift.

This frame also covers several productive metaphor cases. In the first one, movement or change caused by a social entity is conveyed as energy exerted by a physical entity. 'Social' here encompasses entities that are economic, political, technological, historical, cultural, and intimate:
The private sector|Exer is so much more|Deg dynamic.
Singh had been under intense political pressure|Exer.
Economies|Exer are still|Tim sluggish.
Relatedly, the influential effect of an psychological entity is described in terms of energy exertion by a physical entity. 'Psychological' includes the intellectual, emotional, and creative:
Sinead's|Exer emotional|Dom intensity permeates every nuance of every lyric.
He finds the Poet Laureate's theory about Shakespeare|Exer to be more|Deg energetic than persuasive|Deg.
Both metaphors appear to involve a third metaphor, which is the anthropomorphization of processes (see examples directly above) or inhuman entities (e.g. in nature):
The lazy creak|Act of sails
The energetic waves|Exer
A broad, lethargic river|Exer
Further, there is a metonymy wherein energy exerted by people carrying out an activity characterizes instead a central object or other component of the activity:
Lucker plays lazy games|Act.
She thought the lazy days|Exer in France would never end.

Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., """"a tad"""", """"a little"""", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame. However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication. Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number (""""a little whiskey"""", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average (""""a mite stupid"""", """"somewhat confused"""" see Degree). Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed. Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category (""""something of a klutz""""), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition (""""I, like, waved it around""""). In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.

Identity is not the same as appearance or name (if the Instance even has such), although these attributes of the Instance may be useful in establishing Identity. Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used. For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents contributes to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or """"true"""" in a given context. Just as we would consider gun in """"fake gun"""" to contain a reference to the normal concept of Weapon, we consider identity in """"multiple identities"""" to belong to this frame, even if only one of the identities is legitimate. Multiple identities can also exist when each is primarily associated with a fragment or aspect of the history and attributes of an entity, and the """"true"""" identity might be very much debatable; in most such cases, there are different names associated with the different identities, as in the case of stage names or Ellis-Island names, but sometimes, the different """"identities"""" go under the same name (e.g., some members of secret societies). While these may be considered different identities, they refer to the same person.
This frame is intended to cover cases where an entity is mentioned, but the category it fits is what is actually meant:

Such sentences should be understood as determining which Instance of the supercategory is intended.
This frame is not intended to cover related, and often more common, uses of the word """"identity"""" such as """"sexual identity"""", """"national identity"""", or """"brand identity"""", which do not refer to a unique identity of an Instance, or even the identity of a supercategory of the Instance, but rather refer to the specific properties of an Instance that are considered very important for how the Instance operates in aggregate.

Ground
Profiled_region","A Figure is located in the interior (the Profiled_region--see Locative_relation frame) of the Ground. Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).
This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary. In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion (""""in a box""""), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change (""""in the garden""""). The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.
The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .
My keys were in the street .
Step back outside . CNI DNI
She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .
I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI
They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI
Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .
We talked outside the office .
This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event. (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.)
The pole snapped off in her hand .
She combed her hair between her fingers .
In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:
[Inside|Target] my wallet is where i put it .
[Outside|Target] your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .
As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following:
They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI
This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).
Is the economy in recession ?
There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI
Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer's mind (construed as a Ground):
You close your ears to the small voice within DNI
I felt an unease inside me .
It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .
I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .
The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground):
Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .
There are so many children in the family .
Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive:
In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target:
amid the confusion
inside the competition period
between lunch and dinner
However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word """"period"""") while others can take events as Grounds directly.
In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground):
In the paper , `` self-control '' is used to mean a sense of willpower .
Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .
Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep.
This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.",Interior_profile_relation ,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/572,ExactMatch,

Exerter
Force","An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (""""a STRONG person"""") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (""""a STRONG push""""). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.
Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer|Exer.
Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow|Act.
A powerful force|For tore off the tree's branches.
Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set.
There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate:
There were theoretical limits to the power of the king|Exer.
Voters in the South have a strong incentive|Exer to keep such Democrats in office.
Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well:
Poetic words in a text|Exer can be given more|Deg emotive|Dom power by using melisma.
He was a forceful speaker|Exer.
A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (?STRONGEST critics?; ?MIGHTY uproar?).
Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.
This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame's FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding core FE.
This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE's capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE's tendency. For example, """"a STRONG person"""" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while """"an ENERGETIC person"""" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.
However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - """"a STRONG push"""" and """"an ENERGETIC push"""" seem rather comparable.",Level_of_force_exertion,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/1391,ExactMatch,

","Opposing_force
Resisting_entity","A Resisting_entity is capable of resisting or does resist a physical Opposing_force to a level specified by the target. With certain LUs (e.g. impregnable.a), the Opposing_force FE is incorporated, and with many LUs, it is mostly null instantiated. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (""""the DURABILITY of jade"""") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (""""the shoulder is PLIABLE after stretching""""), although the individual-level meaning is the more basic and is much more prominent in the data.
The great and impregnable fortress|Ent still stands today.
His heart|Ent is by no means|Degree strong, so he should ease into his exercise regime. INI|Opp
They were strapping athletic lads with fine belts and sturdy boots|Ent. INI|Opp
The staircase|Ent remained robust under decades of heavy use|Opp.
Productive metaphors include cases where the social resistance of an entity to (an) opposing social force(s) is conceptualized as the physical resistance of an entity to an opposing physical force. More specifically, the ?resistance? is an entity?s propensity to resist change in social realms such as the economic, political, and cultural:
California has had (until now) a robust property market|Ent. INI|Opp
The durability of the peace|Ent will soon be tested. INI|Opp
Similarly, there are instances where the entity?s resistance is psychological instead of social, where ?psychological? subsumes emotional and other mental properties:
The idea|Ent proved remarkably|Desc durable.
We should remember the fragility of the human psyche|Ent. INI|Opp
His sturdy resilience|Ent to knocks and setbacks was impressive. INI|Opp

Note that in this last example, the PP 'in the sun' is both the Ground on the primary FE layer and Light on the secondary layer.
This frame is similar to the frame Light_movement; however, in Location_of_light, Light is conceived as stationary, while in Light_movement, light is conceived as traveling linearly outward from a light source, via a path, to whatever objects are illuminated.
In both of these light-related frames, there is a very consistent metaphorical conception of emotions as shining in eyes or forth from eyes, including the associated pattern of eyes shining with an emotion. The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion. In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus """"glinting"""", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a """"hard cold"""" emotion like hatred, while """"sparkling"""", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a """"beautiful"""" emotion like amusement or excitement. In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like """"His eyes glistened with tears.""""

This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).
Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements. The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center). In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:
This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.
There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.
In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:
[Inside|Target] my wallet is where I put it .
[Outside|Target] your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .

Sound
Sound_source","A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound. This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such. A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_protagonist and/or a Path.
This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact, and *Cause_friction frames (the last of which is not yet in FrameNet). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time).

Patient","A Patient interacts with one or more Medics (doctors, nurses, and/or EMTs with a responsibility for the Patient's health) so that the Medics can determine the health status of the Patient and maintain or restore the Patient's health as necessary.
Usually, the Patient has an Affliction, a medical problem that motivates or necessitates their coming into the care of a Medic. At a minimum, the Patient has a single interaction with a Medic, but usually the Patient has a relationship with the Medic or group of medical professionals who either have responsibility for helping them with their specific Affliction or for their health in general. Medical interactions normally take place at a Medical_center (a hospital or doctor's office), but in cases where the Patient suffers a sudden catastrophic Affliction, the Patient may be taken into the care of EMTs, who act as their Medic until reaching a medical center.
In some cases, the Body_system that has a problem is mentioned in place of the Affliction.

Practice
Protagonist","The adjectives and nouns in this frame are all based on the idea that mental properties may be attributed to a person (Protagonist) by a (usually implicit) Judge on the basis of that person's Behavior, as broadly understood. Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in It was stupid of me to do that. Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:
She is astute at math.
While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.",Mental_property,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/24,ExactMatch,

That kite you see just to the right of his head was moving around pretty fast but the camera seemed to catch it ok.
There are several accounts of the stench drifting to shore from the ships in the middle of the river
Dust particles floating about made him sneeze uncontrollably.
The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.
The swarm went away to the end of the hall.
The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea. Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract).
A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme. In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:
The plane flew over the city.
In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion. When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicle frame:
Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!
This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:
It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.
Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicle):
I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.
I flew my plane across the Canadian border
Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:
The ball flew over the fence.

Negation can be evoked verbally (analytic or synthetic) or nominally. Negators include """"not"""", """"no"""", """"never"""", and negational affixes, such as those used on inflected verbs in synthetic verbal negation (wasn't, isn't, haven't).

Ground","A Figure is characterized as near the Ground, according to some contextually given scale. Many lexical units of this frame additionally specify in which direction relative to the Ground one can find the Figure (under.prep, north.adv), or directions from the Ground from which the Figure is excluded (e.g. beside.prep excludes the vertical and front/back axes); for specifications of direction, see the semantic types attached to the lexcial units. Members of this frame that make reference to an absolute, earth-based grid (e.g. north, south, etc.) imply a geographic scale of proximity, and so are frequently not paraphrasable as """"near"""".

The subset of LUs that inherently pick out a particular direction (e.g. north, behind) may occur with a specification of a Distance in that direction from a Ground at which the Figure may be found, while LUs that pick out two or more directions of relevance from a Ground (e.g. beside) can only characterize the general accessibility of the Figure relative to the Ground.

Type","The Performers, together with behind the scenes Personnel, execute a Performance according to a Script and/or Score. The purpose of the Performance is to create an experience for an Audience, who then judge its merits. Performances may be in many different Mediums and be of various Types.
This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:
The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.
The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.
The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.
Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.
Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance (and potentially the Script and Score and contributions of other Personnel) to other potential Audience members.
Due to the high quality of previous Performances, Performers can become famous, i.e. well known and liked. Those who like them particularly well become fans of the Performer. (Shared with writers...)

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.
At least I don?t have to go to school|MS.
|MSAva, anyway, knew who he was|MS.
When the Mitigating_situation|MS clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard. The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur. The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school. The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)
Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full Mitigating_situation:
There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.
In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context.
Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them. In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express:
She traveled, and now she is back here to transform|MS our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture|MS.
The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab. Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.
This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form):
Although she?s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.
In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.
If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.

This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons. Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not. Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity. This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer). However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state. Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined. While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text.
Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it. As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame. The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic. In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity:

Protagonist_2","This frame characterizes states-of-affairs with Protagonists in relations with each other that may be viewed symmetrically. When the Protagonists are equally prominent, each equally serving to identify the others, they are expressed together as Protagonists. When one of the Protagonists serves to define the other (more or less as a Ground), it is called Protagonist_2, and the other is called Protagonist_1 (i.e. the Figure).
This frame exists as a background for a number of lexical frames, including Chatting, Similarity, Exchange, and Being_attached. The most basic frames inheriting from this one are symmetrical states. (For example, Being_attached is symmetrical, since if A is attached to B, B is attached to A.)
Other frames exhibiting reciprocality either have a causative/inchoative relation to such a stative frame (e.g. Becoming_attached), or are stative-like summarizations of multiple events of the same kind. This second type, in which events are performed reciprocally, with two equal participants acting on each other, can be exemplified by the Chatting frame in which two people are effectively both speakers and addressees in a joint act of communication.
The basic characteristic of this frame, inherited in the daughters, is the equivalence of Protagonist_1 + Protagonist_2 to Protagonists, and the further equivalence (modulo figure/ground profiling) of the following:
Protagonist_1 Relation with Protagonist_2.
Protagonist_2 Relation with Protagonist_1.

Also, if the Protagonist performs the Means action themselves, the Instrument that they use may be referred to in place of the Means Note that when one of the three interrelated FEs Means, Instrument and Intermediary is realized overtly, the other two are blocked from overt realization as clause-level arguments of the target.
When the Protagonist is a sentient being, it is implied that they put their trust in the Intermediary to help in the achievement of the Benefit.
The extent to which the Protagonist is dependent on an Intermediary or Instrument can be indicated in a Degree phrase.
A set of Circumstances in which the Protagonist's need for the Benefit arises, may also be specified.
The difference between the Benefit that the Means action provides and the Purpose that the Protagonist has is very subtle. For our purposes we will assume that one can form a predication from Benefit and Means on the one hand, and Protagonist and Purpose on the other, but that they cannot be intermingled (cf. examples (7) and (8) below). With for-PPs such as in (6) it is not clear which FE they instantiate, Benefit or Purpose. We will arbitrarily call them Benefit

State","A Cognizer calls up an episodic memory of past Experience or an Impression of a Salient_entity formed on the basis of past experience. The Cognizer may also remember the Salient_entity in a particular State, which serves as a frame of reference in the Cognizer's mind. When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.
Episodic memory is the explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.

Notice that this frame is very general. It can be used to talk about detailed reports of past experience.
I don't know if I lost consciousness for a while. But I remember that I was lying in the middle of the road with people trying to assist me|men.
Notice that Mental_content reported within this frame is presented as factive, i.e. as reliable and accurate. Consider the following contrasts:
1a. I remember her as selfish--but I might be wrong.
1b. ??I remember that she was selfish--but I might be wrong.
2a. Bill remembers her as smarter than she is.
2b.*Bill remembers that she is smarter than she is.
The (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest that the Cognizer takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate.
The concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.
3a. I remember her fondly
3b. Please take a moment to remember Caesar and his Family.
3c. Do you remember Alexander the Great|men? He was one of history's most prolific conquerors, and he did it all in his twenties.
This frame differs from Remembering_to_do in that this frame is strictly talking about a fact, whereas the Remembering_to_do frame is strictly about tasks which the Cognizer would be expected to do.

Services","In this frame, a Booker brings about a situation where an Organization plans to provide Services to a Client at a particular Scheduled_time. The Organization has authority over when Services are provided to whom. The Booker usually has to communicate and negotiate with the Organization to plan the Services for a mutually agreeable Scheduled_time. Usually, there is a Payment as well.
We can book you a boatride on the Somme or a special tour of the Louvre .

In many cases, the Booker may be the same as the Client or the Organization.
When the Booker is also the Organization providing the service, as in the first sentence below, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Organization on the second. Realizing that the Booker is also the Organization providing the service is an inference, as we can see by comparing the following two examples. In the first, it seems clear that the hotel is providing the service. In the second, it is clear that the hotel is not providing the service.
The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights .
The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights at the adjacent hotel to make up for screwing up our original booking .
In the frequent case where the Booker is the same as the Client, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Client on the second. Client is on the second layer since, in most cases, it is an inference that may be wrong. For example, in the following sentence, the annotation indicates that Patrick is the Client. However, it is also possible that Patrick is reserving a table for a party that doesn't even include himself:

Self_motion most prototypically involves individuals moving under their own power by means of their bodies. Many words also specify the manner of motion (swim, walk). This frame contains mostly words that fit this prototypical scenario, but the frame itself does not specify whether a separate vehicle is impossible, necessary, or unspecified. Lexical units that involve separate vehicles are associated with FEs that are not appropriate for the more general case of motion, so they are placed in the Operate_vehicle or Ride_vehicle frames (e.g., He drove across the country, She flew to Europe).

The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver_agentive FE used in the Perception_active frame.)

The Intermediary's intent is to repurchase the Assets from the Market at a lower price than when he sold them, and so return them to the Lender for a profit.
Because this strategy only makes sense when the Intermediary believes that the value of the Assets is lower than the valuation assigned by other members of the market, words of this frame may be used metaphorically to refer to an Agent (usually wrongly) believing some Entity is worth less than other people do.

There are an enormous number of productive metaphors that involve this frame as the source domain; two of the most frequent metaphors come from the target domains of quantity/amount and importance.

The novel was a substantial achievement.
Subcases of the quantity/amount and importance metaphors are also prominent. These involve cases describing the extent of an action's, event's, or person's effect (""""his influence on her work was massive""""), as well as those related to events (""""big party""""), similarity (""""gigantic difference""""), communication (""""giant misunderstanding""""), and emotions (""""great joy"""", """"little joys"""").
Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. """"giant electronics company"""") and those describing sound volume (""""in a tiny voice"""", """"the enormous thundering of her heart"""").
The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a. Maturity and age also occur in non-productive metaphors (""""big boy"""", """"little baby"""").

In talking about sounds, speakers often provide information about how the sound was produced. A Noisy_event may be mentioned which gives rise to the sound. Alternatively, the sound may be attributed to a Sound_source, which is construed as a point source emitting the sound. A further possible specification of what gives rise to the sound is for speakers to talk about two physical entities coming into contact by motion, resulting in either friction or impact.
Although this frame is defined in terms of a phenomenon of objective reality, many instances of the LUs in this frame are metonymic references to purely psychological phenomena due to a strong metaphorical relationship between external and internal reality. Furthermore, many of the LUs in this frame such as chuckle.n or whimper.n require a perceiver's analysis of a sound rather than being purely descriptive.

Ground","A Figure is located essentially at the same location as a Ground, which is viewed as point-like, or having no important internal or external structure. Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small. Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why """"at the store"""" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case """"in the store"""" would be more usual).

This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space. Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.

Ground
Figures","A Figure is located in contact with a Ground. With some words that evoke this frame, the Figure is also asserted to be fully or partially supported by the Ground (e.g. on), while in others a support relation is either denied (e.g. to, as in """"she put her hand to the wall"""") or unspecified (e.g. against). In addition, some LUs assert a direction in which to find the Figure from the Ground (e.g. atop).
There was a tight-fitting lid on the bottle .
Against the back wall stood a young black man staring at his shoes .
Against the back wall three students were reading .
Clean if the jewelery is ever in contact with water or chlorine .
This frame participates in productive metaphor cases, like """"shining a light on corruption"""", """"Stalin's hand lay heavy on the presses"""", """"it touched her heart"""" in each of which an abstract entity affects another entity as if they were in physical contact.
This frame is intended to cover the description of writing, images, or situations being depicted on a document, canvas, screen, or other flat surface, including metaphorical cases where there is no literal document, like """"on record"""" or """"pretty low on my list"""".
They were arguing on screen .
Watching chess is pretty low on my list .
The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support. The sense distinction is proven by the omissability of the Ground only in the vehicle cases:
She is already on (the bus/the ship...) .
My paper is on *(the desk) .
This use is related to Ride_vehicle. A similar argument holds for uses of on.prep with a clothing Figure, which virtually always omits the Ground; see Wearing.
The use of on.prep and upon.prep for Topics is considered a non-productive metaphor (see Topic). No other target in the frame allows the use, nor is is correlated with other language of the source domain of contact (e.g. stand, sit, lie, put, rest).

The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.
LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.
This construction can be defined as follows:
A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

Topic","A Speaker succeeds in getting an Addressee to believe or plan to execute the Content the Speaker has in mind. In most cases, the information is related to some course of action for the Addressee, and the words of this frame imply that the Addressee has formed an intention to act consistently with the Content. There is no implication that the Addressee actually acts upon the intention formed. In the case of convince and persuade, the act that the Speaker wishes the Addressee to perform can be the adoption of a belief, which may be expressed as a that-clause or as an of-PP complement.
This frame differs from Attempt_suasion in that in Suasion, the Addressee has changed their mind in accord with the Speaker's wishes, whereas in Attempt_suasion, the only implication is that the Speaker communicates with the intent of changing the mind of the Addressee.
This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Eventive_cognizer_affecting frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.

Ground
Profiled_region","A Figure surrounds a Ground. The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v). Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.
The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .
The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .
This frame resembles the Abounding_with frame, in that both involve a Figure """"covering"""" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure. For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements).
In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically """"impinging"""" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following:

Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions ('the hopelessness surrounding them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed').
This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.",Surrounding,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/1199,ExactMatch,

Also, there is no emphasis on the temporal profiling in Transition_to_a_situation other than the before (where the Final_situation is not true) to the after (where the Final_situation is true).

Final_quality","An Entity ends up in a Final_category, Final_situation, or Final_quality which it was not in before. Some members of the frame (e.g. grow.v) tend to emphasize a gradual change, while most members of the frame do not indicate whether a change is gradual or not.

This frame should be compared to Undergo_change. Undergo_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity. This shows up both in Undergo_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. got/turned red). In addition, when Undergo_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity.
Compare the previous sentence to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal (albeit in a different frame). In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', the meaning is either as a replacement of other OS-s or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS-s.

Trials have a rich schematic structure which is only partially represented here. The Trial frame is the part of the Criminal Process frame that occurs after a crime, Arrest of a suspect, Arraignment, jury selection, etc. and before Sentencing and punishment or release. The Trial is made up of court appearances. The beginning of the Trial generally involves opening arguments, in which the Prosecution and the Defense present their respective points of view. Then during the course of the Trial, both sides present evidence, some of which is provided by witnesses with testimony, and this is then drawn upon as support for their arguments. Following the presentation of evidence, testimony, and arguments, generally culminating in closing arguments for each side, the Jury (if present) deliberates and either comes to no sufficient consensus or produces a Verdict.",Trial,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/181,ExactMatch,

Prize","A Competitor claims a Prize as a result of the outcome of their participation in a Competition. Competition is meant to be construed broadly to include cases where there is no skill involved as well as cases where there is no ranking of participants, and indeed does not require that there be multiple pariticipants or a definable end of game, as in the case of winning prizes at a carnival game. All that is required to be this kind of Competition is that there is some way of determining whether a Competitor will receive the Prize.

We won a car in the raffle.



The use of win.v in this frame is similar to the Finish_competition frame, but there are a number of differences. Firstly, Win_prize focuses on what the Competitor receives as a result of their participation in a process. Unlike Finish_competition, Win_prize does not necessarily give any information about how a Competitor ranked relative to other competitors, or even if there is any system of ranking of competitors, or any end of the process that is defined as winning or losing. Win_prize only requires a system for determining which Prize or prizes go to a Competitor, if any. That is why the opposite of """"I won (something)"""" in Win_prize is not """"I lost"""", but rather """"I didn't win anything"""".",Win_prize,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/928,ExactMatch,

Topic","An Experiencer continually thinks about some Topic whose consequences are important to the Experiencer and considered not yet known or resolved. The Experiencer has difficulty in NOT thinking about the Topic and continually feels the urge to act in some way, but the available actions are not sufficiently productive to be satisfying or to ensure a good outcome related to the Topic. As a result, worry may drive the Experiencer to negative consequences like unsettled digestion, disturbed sleep, and frantic, pointless, and repetitive action.

Pat is still worrying about the exam.


This frame can be thought of as a blend of a basic emotion frame with Cogitation, but differs from Cogitation in emphasizing the emotional consequence of thinking about something.

This frame has similarities to Experiencer_focus, but here the verbs are more 'active' in meaning. (For example, they often occur in negative imperatives, e.g. """"Don't worry!''). They also differ from Experiencer_focus verbs in that they occur with Topic expressions and can be used in the present progressive:
*Pat is fearing the exam.
All of these characteristics are a result of Worry being an activity that has a duration and is partially under the control of the Experiencer.",Worry,https://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/showFrame/1434,ExactMatch,
